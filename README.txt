New to Aqueduct? Check out the tutorial in ./tutorial. 
There is an fsharp script for the impatient, and a word doc that walks through the script.
There is a small sample in the ./sample directory that contains essentially the same code as in the
tutorial but gets built into an executable.

You can build the aqueduct library with the visual studio solution at src/Aqueduct.fsproj.
Note that it is visual studio 2010 (from the beta) since that is what I currently have installed. If 
a vs2008 project would work better, let us know.

Building also creates html documentation under the src/doc directory.
